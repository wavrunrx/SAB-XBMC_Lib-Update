SAB-XBMC_Lib-Update
===================

a post-processing script for SABnzbd to automatically update a local or remote XBMC library with movie/tv metadata

Setup:
the only setup involved with the script itself, is to change the values of the variables defined early on in the script.
once this is done, place the script somewhere in SABnzbd's root dir (.sabnzbd) and grant it +x.
set the script for use in SABnzbd under config ---> categories
